This directory contains videos to accompany the paper J.M.Brooke and S.P.Wilson "Cortical domain size alone cannot explain
within-domain patterning". This is also chapter 3 of J.M.Brooke Phd Thesis "The effects of geometry and dynamics on biological pattern
formation".

The videos are in directories which take the name of the relevant figure in the paper. The videos in them are named in
relation to their position in the figure.

The videos show the dynamical nature of pattern formation from random initial conditions in a manner which cannot be fully
captured by the still images in the paper.
