This directory contains the code for creating tessellations of triangles.
Since it uses a different method of creating the triangular meshes from
the Voronoi class DRegion, we have to use ksRegion.h. The code also uses
the Visual class for the graphics hence it does not need the old morphologica
display library.

To build and run

1. Make a build directory and compile from it with cmake ..

2. make ksTriangle builds the executable

3. Then we have to prepare the json file by editing and running kst.

4. Finally run with python runksTriangle.py
